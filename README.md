Arrays:

Arrays in java are a fixed size data structure to store elements of the same data type. 
Elements are in an array and are accesses by their index number staring with 0. 
This has better performance because they are directly accessible to their mapped memory locations. 
Lastly once the size of the array has been created it cannot be changed.

ArrayList:

ArrayLists are similar with the exception that they are dynamic and resizable. 
They also store elements but they can be of different types and are automatically capable of resizing. 
ArrayLists are more convenient to allow for the modification of elements to include adding, removing, and manipulating them. 
However they can be slower to access because they require more processing overhead for its dynamic resizing.

Differences:

Size:
arrays are fixed size.
ArrayList is Dynamic and can be manipulated.

Type:
Arrays store one data type.
ArrayLists can store elements of different data types.

Performance:
Arrays are usually faster to access elements.
ArrayLists are more flexible but come with a slightly slower performance cost.
